# CSS-HGAT-SSP

To tackle the challenge of spatiotemporal data sparsity in disaster scenarios, we propose a method for flood risk prediction that leverages the principle of geographic similarity (<b>CSS-HGAT-SSP</b>). By aggregating information from distant neighbors, the approach enhances predictive accuracy and resilience.

The code for the proposed method includes four steps: **neighborhood order selection, risk spatial prediction based on semantic spatial association graphs, daily geographic unit representation generation, and risk temporal prediction**, which correspond to the four code files: *1_neighborhood_order_selection_CSS-HGAT.py, 2_construction_of_semantic_graph.py, 3_temporal_prediction_daily_representation.py, 4_temporal_prediction_CSS-HGAT-SSP.py*, respectively.

## 3. Experimental Steps

### Step 1. Data processing

After collecting the necessary experimental data, data preprocessing is conducted as the first step.

#### Step 1.1 Raster data processing

For raster data, processing is performed using Python-based ArcGIS Pro functionalities. *In the uploaded <b>0_rasterDataProcess.py</b>, functions for projection and clipping, as well as multi-value extraction to points, are implemented based on the arcpy module*. Download and install ArcGIS Pro from the following link: https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview. Subsequently, unify the coordinate system of the raster data to the Krasovsky_1940_Albers projection and extract the corresponding attribute values within each 500-meter grid.

<b>(1) Clipping and projection</b>
```
def clipProject (clip_folder,project_folder,fname):
    """
        Clips a raster to the specified extent and then projects it to a new coordinate system.

        Parameters:
        clip_folder (str): The folder path where the clipped raster will be saved.
        project_folder (str): The folder path where the projected raster will be saved.
        fname (str): The filename of the input raster.

        Returns:
        str: The file path of the projected raster.
    """
    # Clip the raster
    clipath = clip_folder + "ZhengzhouClip_" + fname
    arcpy.Clip_management(
        fname, "112 34 115 35", #The bounding rectangle extent of Zhengzhou City.
        clipath, "#", "#", "NONE")

    # Project the clipped raster.
    prjpath = project_folder + "ZhengzhouProject_" + fname
    arcpy.ProjectRaster_management(clipath, prjpath,
                                   "Krasovsky_1940_Albers.prj", "BILINEAR", "500", #Projected to the Krasovsky_1940_Albers coordinate system.
                                   "GCS_WGS_1984_to_GCS_Krasovsky_1940", "#", "#")

    return 0
```

<b>(2) Extract raster values to points</b>
```
def valuesToPoints (project_folder,fname):
    """
       Extracts raster values to points from a specified raster file.

       Parameters:
       project_folder (str): The folder path where the projected raster is located.
       fname (str): The filename of the input raster.

       Returns:
       int: Returns 0 upon successful execution.
    """
    # Define the point features to which raster values will be extracted.
    inPointFeature = "./experimental_data/Grids_in_Zhengzhou/Grid500_label.shp"

    # Define the input raster and field name.
    inTif = project_folder + "ZhengzhouProject_" + fname
    inField = fname[:-4]

    # Append the raster and field to the extract list.
    inList.append([inTif, inField])
    ExtractMultiValuesToPoints(inPointFeatures, inList, "BILINEAR")

    # Export the extracted values to a CSV file with specified fields.
    # export_ASCII = inTif[:-4] "_500.csv"
    # arcpy.ExportXYv_stats(input_features,["FID", "ID", inField], "COMMA", export_ASCII, "ADD_FIELD_NAMES")

    return 0
```

#### Step 1.2 Weibo data preprocessing

### Step 2. Neighborhood order selection (Environmental representation of geographical units)

<b>(1) Selecting the optimal neighborhood for environmental representation</b>

*We integrate multi-order neighborhoods into the GAT framework for geographic unit environmental characterization, with the uploaded <b>0_rasterDataProcess.py</b>.*
The resulting representations of different neighborhood order stored in the "./experimental_results/(1)_neighborhood_selection" folder. 

<b>(2) Comparative verification</b>

These results are compared with those obtained using mainstream methods such as <b>DeepWalk, Node2Vec, GAE, GCN, and GraphSAGE</b>, with the representations from different methods are stored in the "./experimental_results/(2)_embeddings" folder. The corresponding code is located in the "./program_embedding" folder, as detailed below.

| File                            | Content                                   |

### Step 3. Risk spatial prediction based on semantic association graph

We construct a semantic spatial correlation graph and establish local and global features. Through multi-stage label propagation, we enable flood risk prediction that accounts for changes in geographic unit attributes.

#### Step 3.1 Construction of the semantic association graph

*Semantic spatial association graphs are constructed by selecting 1 to 10 nearest neighbor nodes respectively, to explore the impact of different numbers of nearest neighbor nodes on spatial prediction of disaster risk, as shown in the uploaded code <b>2_construction_of_semantic_graph.py</b>.*

#### Step 3.2 Ablation of the risk prediction module
A comparison of CSS-HGAT-SSP with two other methods is conducted using the following three metrics: weighted precision, weighted recall, and micro ROC-AUC, as detailed below.

| File                            | Content                                   |

| ./method_comparison/program_prediction_parameter/(2)_module_ablation_CSS-HGAT-Cluster.py         | Evaluates predictions based on the learned environmental representations of geographic units using multi-stage label propagation.|

#### Step 3.3 Comparison of spatial prediction results for disaster risk

These spatial prediction results for disaster risk are compared with those obtained using mainstream methods such as <b>SVM, MLP, PageRank, DeepWalk, GCN, and GraphSAGE</b>. The corresponding code is located in the "./method_comparison/program_spatial_prediction" folder, as detailed below.

| File                            | Content                                   |

The results of constructing semantic spatial association graphs based on different numbers of nearest neighbor nodes for clustering are saved in the "./experimental_results/(3)_knn_results" folder.

### Step 4. Temporal prediction of disaster risks

#### Step 4.1 Daily geographic unit representation generation

*Based on the aforementioned experimental results, an appropriate number of neighboring nodes is selected to generate daily unit environmental representations between July 15 and July 25. The experimental process is executed according to the uploaded code file <b>3_temporal_prediction_daily_representation.py</b>.*

#### Step 4.2 Risk temporal prediction

*By leveraging the Transformer model, we capture the dependencies between different time steps and integrate the environmental representations of geographic units over multiple days, allowing us to predict the geographic unit's label for the next time step, as shown in the uploaded code <b>4_temporal_prediction_CSS-HGAT-SSP.py</b>.* 

#### Step 4.3 Comparison of temporal prediction results for disaster risk
we compare the temporal prediction results of CSS-HGAT-Cluster based directly on the environmental representation of each date and CSS-HGAT-SSP based on the semantic association graph. The corresponding code is located in the "./method_comparison/program_temporal_prediction" folder, as detailed below.

| File                            | Content                                   |

The results of this process are saved in three folders: "./experimental_results/(4)_temporal_embeddings", "./experimental_results/(5)_temporal_model" and "./experimental_results/(6)_temporal_prediction".

| Folder                            | Included Files                                   |
