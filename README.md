# CSS-HGAT-SSP

To tackle the challenge of spatiotemporal data sparsity in disaster scenarios, we propose a method for flood risk prediction that leverages the principle of geographic similarity (<b>CSS-HGAT-SSP</b>). By aggregating information from distant neighbors, the approach enhances predictive accuracy and resilience.

## 3. Experimental Steps

### 3.1 Data preprocessing

After collecting the necessary experimental data, data preprocessing is conducted as the first step. For raster imagery data, the following operations are performed using ArcGIS Pro software (available for download at https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview): <br>(1) Create a vector grid within Zhengzhou city with a 500-meter side length. <br>(2) Standardize the coordinate system to the Krasovsky_1940_Albers projection.<br>(3) Use the "Zonal Statistics" tool to unify the raster scale to 500 meters.<br>(4) Extract multidimensional attribute values for each unit using the "Extract Multi Values to Points" tool.

The process of extracting flood disaster impact information based on Weibo data is detailed in our previously published paper, "Fine-grained flood disaster information extraction incorporating multiple semantic features," in the International Journal of Digital Earth <sup>[2]</sup>. The preprocessed data is saved in the "experimental_data" directory, as detailed below.

### 3.2 Environmental representation of geographical units

We integrate multi-order neighborhoods into the GAT framework for geographic unit environmental characterization, with the resulting representations stored in the "./experimental_results/(1)_neighborhood_selection" folder. These results are compared with those obtained using mainstream methods such as GAE, GCN, and Node2Vec, with the representations from different methods are stored in the "./experimental_results/(2)_embeddings" folder. The corresponding code is located in the "./program_embedding" folder, as detailed below.

### 3.3 Flood disaster risk prediction

We construct a semantic spatial correlation graph and establish local and global features. Through multi-stage label propagation, we enable flood risk prediction that accounts for changes in geographic unit attributes.

#### 3.3.1 Prediction_parameter settings

The experimental parameter settings include the selection of the number of nearest neighbor nodes and the ablation of the risk prediction module, as detailed below.

#### 3.3.2 Spatial prediction of disaster risks

Based on the semantic similarity graph, this method integrates both local and global features of nodes to achieve spatial prediction of disaster risks. By extracting local features from nodes and combining them with environmental representations of the nodes, a feature representation that incorporates both local and global information is obtained. Further, multi-stage label propagation is employed to cluster nodes and propagate labels, utilizing the graph's structural information to refine label assignment. The corresponding code is located in the "./program_spatial_prediction" folder, as detailed below.

| File                            | Content                                   |

The results of constructing semantic spatial association graphs based on different numbers of nearest neighbor nodes for clustering are saved in the "./experimental_results/(3)_knn_results" folder.

#### 3.3.2 Temporal prediction of disaster risks

To account for the varying influence of representations from different preceding days on the disaster status of a geographic unit on the next day, we introduce a self-attention mechanism to dynamically adjust the weights of each time step. By leveraging the Transformer model, we capture the dependencies between different time steps and integrate the environmental representations of geographic units over multiple days, allowing us to predict the geographic unit's label for the next time step. The corresponding code is located in the "./program_temporal_prediction" folder, as detailed below.

| File                            | Content                                   |
